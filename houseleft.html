     <h1>the house you left me.</h1>
     <p class="desc">My game the house you left me is the story of a woman who is exploring a house. The house has been left to her by her best friend, who has been found dead in the house under mysterious circumstances. This is a short, interactive game that provides two different endings depending on choices made by the player. It explores themes of isolation, acceptance, and grief. <br> This was my BFA project for SJSU. It was made using the Narrat program, utilizing HTML, CSS, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe After Effects.<br> The game can be played <a href="https://dawndeer.itch.io/the-house-you-left-me">here</a>.</p>
